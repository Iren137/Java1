**Quizer library**
===

This is an application to test the knowledge of students.

The application functions as follows: the teacher breaks into the classroom and decides to conduct a planned knowledge test, writes the name of the test on the board. Delighted by the great news, the students, in turn, willingly open this application and enter the name of the test into the CLI. Then they (presumably on their own) answer all the questions, and at the end they are given a score.
